\section{Brackets and bracket-like functions}

You can specify a bracket size using $-1,\dots,4$, where $-1$ uses \texttt{\textbackslash left} and \texttt{\textbackslash right}, $0$ uses nothing, and positive numbers 
use increasingly large fixed sizes. When inline, bracket sizes are not adjusted.

\bitems
\item Regular brackets:  \verb!\rbra{\frac{x}{y}}!
    \bitems
    \item Inline: $\rbra{\frac{x}{y}}$ 
    \item Display: $\displaystyle\rbra{\frac{x}{y}}$
    \eitems
\item Curly brackets: \verb!\cbra[2]{\frac{x}{y}}!
    \bitems
    \item Inline: $\cbra[2]{\frac{x}{y}}$
    \item Display: $\displaystyle\cbra[2]{\frac{x}{y}}$
    \eitems
\item Square brackets: \verb!\sbra[4]{\frac{x}{y}}!
    \bitems
    \item Inline: $\sbra[4]{\frac{x}{y}}$
    \item Display: $\displaystyle\sbra[4]{\frac{x}{y}}$
    \eitems
\eitems
Other bracket-like, semantic command are also available, including \verb!\abs!, \verb!\set!, \verb!\floor!, \verb!\ceil!, \verb!\norm!, \verb!\inner!, and \verb!\card!.
